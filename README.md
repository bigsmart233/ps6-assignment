I basically follow the sample provided for us. This code creates a Shiny app that visualizes and analyzes satellite temperature data. The app has three tabs: "About", "Plots", and "Table".
I finish most of the functionality in the sample. Including generate random sample table and add trend in plot. For page two and three, the layout is pretty complex including sidepanel and mainpanel within sidebarLayout.

In the page one, I successfully generate a table with 5 samples of data, also I use two types of marker. There are explantory text on the top

In the page two, I succefully create reactive ggplot and at least two widgets including single checkbox and checkboxgroup. The data left untouched and visuals can be changed bi clicking displays trends and region button, the trend line will appear and changed according to the region selected.
